Final Project

* The project that I ended up implementing was still an Arduino Plant Watering System. 
In my proposal, I stated that I was going to use a water pump but instead I used a dc motor as a proof of concept. 
I also used the lcd to show temperature and humidity instead of tank water level because I ended up not using a water pump.

* I think it is safe to say that 100% of my project is working but improvements can always be made.

* Steps:
o First Step: Bought all the parts I needed to implement the project
o Second Step: Looked up how each part worked (Google and YouTube)
o Third step: Looked up how to connect each part to the Arduino and breadboard (Google and YouTube)
o Fourth Step: Had to play with variables because sometimes it would read something as dry even though it was semi wet and sometimes read wet when it was dry.
o Fifth Step: figured out how to connect and use dc motor because I could not use the water pump I ordered. (Google and YouTube)
o Sixth Step: After testing that the humidity/temperature sensor worked and that the soil moisture sensor worked, I added the lcd to my breadboard
o Seventh Step: Testing

* I ended up not using the water pump, wall adapter, and MOSFET that I ordered. No extra hardware were purchased

* It took me about a day to connect everything together and another day for the code (Testing included)

* I used a function from online as an example/template for my waterPlants function ("//from online" in my source code)
